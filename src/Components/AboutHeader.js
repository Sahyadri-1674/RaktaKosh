            Welcome to RaktKosh Blood Bank, where saving lives through the power
            of blood donation is our mission. Established with a heartfelt
            commitment to providing a steady and reliable source of blood,
            RaktKosh is more than just a blood bankâ€”it's a lifeline for
            individuals in need and a community of compassionate donors.<br/><br/>
            RaktKosh was founded by a group of passionate individuals
            who recognized the critical need for a well-organized and efficient
            blood donation system. Witnessing the challenges faced by patients
            in accessing timely and safe blood, our founders were driven to
            bridge the gap between donors and recipients.
